# TrashSortingGame
Python "falling objects" Game. As trash falls from the sky the user must click on the image and decide whether it is "recyclable" or "garbage" and sort the trash with the arrow keys, but don't sort wrong or let the trash fall off the screen, or you will lose lives!
When the user clicks an image, that image only stops on the screen and waits for the user to press "right" or "left".
After a keyboard-input is detected the object's X-coordinate will increase/decrease rather than moving in the y-direction(up and down).
After a piece of trash falls off the screen a trash bag shows up on the left-hand side of the screen, if another falls another bag appears above it. 
You can accumulate a total of 12 bags before getting a game over.
If by chance you sort a recycable good into the trash, or vicce versa, you will lose 1 of your 5 lives.
To make things harder, after a certain number of pieces have been sorted, the speed at which they falls increases dramatically.
This game was created from python and pygame graphics.
